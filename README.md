### Inspiration

[(Back to top)](#list-of-contents)

After months of extensive searching, we realised there was not a single repository that could guide a newbie to machine learning and natural language processing in Ruby. Thus, after a series of naming discussions, `sciruby-examples` was born.

### Installing IRuby

[(Back to top)](#list-of-contents)
